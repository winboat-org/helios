//! cxx bridge to DXVK's C++ engine.
//!
//! The UMD's `d3d10umddi` frontend (Rust) calls into DXVK's `DxvkInstance`/
//! `DxvkAdapter`/`DxvkDevice` through this bridge. The C++ side (`bridge/
//! dxvk_bridge.cpp`) owns the DXVK `Rc<>` objects inside an opaque
//! `HeliosDxvkDevice`; Rust holds it via `UniquePtr`.
//!
//! Backend Vulkan device = the Gate-5a venus ICD; the shim force-selects it via
//! `DXVK_FILTER_DEVICE_NAME="Virtio-GPU Venus"` before creating the instance.
