//! TEMPORARY post-start bring-up tracer (remove once Code 43 / AddAdapter clears).
//!
//! dxgkrnl's StartAdapter→AddAdapter sequence drives a series of our DDIs and can
//! fail internally (e.g. `STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND`) with no NTSTATUS we get
//! to see. To find which DDI dxgkrnl is calling (and which we answer how) right
//! before it gives up, each instrumented PASSIVE-level DDI calls [`record`],
//! which appends a `REG_DWORD` breadcrumb as values `S0`, `S1`, `S2`, … under
//! `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\helios_kmd_render`. After a repro read them in
//! order (`reg query` / `Get-ItemProperty`); the last few before the failure
//! point at the culprit.
//!
//! IRQL: `RtlWriteRegistryValue` requires PASSIVE_LEVEL — only call [`record`]
//! from PASSIVE DDIs (never the DPC/ISR or DISPATCH paging paths).
//!
//! Breadcrumb code encoding (high byte = which DDI, low bytes = detail):
