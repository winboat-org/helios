//! The D3D12 UMD's `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Helios` registry knobs.
//!
//! ⛔ **The knob VALUES are per-crate and that is D3b's explicit instruction**
//! (`helios_umd_common::knobs` says the same at its own head): only the
//! *mechanism* — the single audited `advapi32!RegGetValueA` site, [`BoolKnob`]
//! and `DwordKnob` — is shared. Sharing the *table* would mean one driver's A/B
//! lever silently applying to the other, and `UserModeDriverName[3]` is supposed
//! to be the only coupling between `helios_umd.dll` and `helios_umd12.dll`.
//!
//! ⚠ Which is why the trace knob here is `Umd12Trace` and **not** `UmdTrace`.
//! They are different registry values in the *same* hive: the hive is shared on
//! purpose (the owner types these by hand and a second subkey would be a second
//! thing to remember), the value names are not. `UmdTrace=1` must not turn on
//! per-op chatter in the D3D12 driver, because the two logs are read separately
//! (`umd-<pid>.log` vs `umd12-<pid>.log`) and a shared name would make "trace
//! was on" ambiguous across two files.
//!
//! | Value | Type | Absent |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Umd12Trace` | DWORD | `false` (explicit non-zero enables) |
//!
//! ⛔ **`UmdD3D12` is deliberately NOT here.** It is the D3D12 kill switch, and
//! a kill switch for a driver that cannot be reached kills nothing: it lands at
//! **S5**, in the same commit that registers slot 3 and makes `OpenAdapter12`'s
//! body reachable. Declaring it now would put a knob in the inventory line whose
//! value provably has no effect — the `DECISIONS.md` §7.1 / R908 failure mode in
//! miniature.
